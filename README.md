 Portfolio project showcasing automated testing with Pytest and GitHub Actions using Page Object Model (POM)

 # 🧪 QA Automation Portfolio – Jenkins | Pytest | GitHub Actions

Hi, I’m a Software QA Automation Engineer and this is a real-world demo of how I contribute to automated testing within a collaborative team setting.

---

## 🎯 Overview

In this 16-minute video, I demonstrate how I:

- Work within a shared Pytest framework using Page Object Model (POM)
- Reuse and extend test logic via fixtures and helper methods
- Choose test tasks from GitHub Project (backlog) based on User Stories
- Create structured Test Case cards with acceptance criteria
- Write automated test scripts according to the selected task
- Run tests locally and push commits via Git CLI
- Open a pull request and await code review before merging to main
- Integrate testing into CI/CD via GitHub Actions

## 📌 User Story Reference

**User Story ID:** `US_04.007`  
**Title:** Multi-configuration project Configuration > Configure Environment  
🔗 [View the full User Story](https://github.com/RedRoverSchool/JenkinsQA_Python_2025_spring/issues/719)

### Description:
> As a user, I want to define and manage settings and variables that define the context in which my build runs, so that each build runs with the correct dependencies and configurations for reliable and repeatable results.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. By navigating to the configuration page of a multi-configuration project, the user can access the “Environment Options” section.  
2. The user can select options such as:
   - Delete workspace before build starts  
   - Use secret text(s) or file(s)  
   - Add timestamps to the Console Output  
   - Inspect build log for published build scans  
   - Terminate a build if it's stuck  
3. After clicking “Save”, the user is redirected to the main project page.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Python** + **Pytest** (modular test framework)
- **Selenium WebDriver** (UI test automation)
- **Page Object Model (POM)** with helper utilities and base pages
- **Git** + **GitHub CLI** (for branching, commits, pull requests)
- **GitHub Projects** (for backlog management and test case planning)
- **GitHub Actions** (for CI/CD pipeline execution)
- **Allure** (for test reporting)
- **Terminal-based test run & logging**

## 🧠 Team Workflow & Quality Practices

- I select a User Story from the project backlog
- I link my test case to the appropriate story, status, and test plan
- I follow one-task–one-PR practice  
- If code refactoring is needed, I create a separate `RF` task and link it as a subtask of the main `TC`
- No additional PRs are created for closed tasks
- I participate in code reviews and improve based on feedback
